## Aussie Shopper
A basic add-on to help Aussie shoppers get the deal. It currently only works on Amazon and allows you to view
the product price in the local AUD currency using the exchange rate set in the options field. Also displays a link
to allow the shopper to find the same product in the AU using StaticIce.

This extension is a work-in-progress and I'll be adding more features with time.
